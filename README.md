Hello.

In this assignment i made a CharactersRemovalController controller with endpoint /reomve to get all data in input_details file , modifies the data and then stores it back to ashutosh_bhardwaj_java_output.

controller makes a call to removeSimilarAdjacentCharacters function in StringModificationService.

StringModificationService uses InputDetailsRepository to get input data and OutputDetailsRepository for inserting output in ouput table.

I created two pojo's. InputDetail and OutputDetail.
